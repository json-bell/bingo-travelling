This is an underway project exploring Next API's integration with the front-end.

It is still in development.

The current live version can still be found hosted on Vercel: https://bingo-travelling.vercel.app/, with a Neon database.

It can also be run locally by cloning the repository and running the development server after specifying an appropriate environment variable connected to a PSQL databse (in `.env.dev`):

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/json-bell/bingo-travelling

# Navigate into the project folder
cd bingo-travelling

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
yarn dev
```
